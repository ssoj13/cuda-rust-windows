# CUDA Rust Windows Fork Policy

## Purpose

This fork adds native Windows support for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` while
keeping Linux behavior upstream-compatible. Windows changes cover build
tools, library discovery, CI, smoke tests, and platform compatibility fixes.

The shared host runtime lives at the repository root. SIMT examples use
those crates through path dependencies; generated standalone projects pin
the runtime and compiler to one fork revision. The isolated backend uses
the in-tree COFF artifact writer; host crates use the published artifact
format and types.

## Upstream Repository

- Upstream: https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-rust
- Upstream branch: `NVIDIA/cuda-rust` `upstream/main`
- Upstream release baseline: CUDA-Oxide 0.2.1
- Primary local branch: `main` Windows release fork branch tracking
  `upstream/main`
- Short-lived branches may be used for experiments, but routine upstream sync
  lands directly on `main`.

## Branch Rules

- `main` remains the Windows release fork branch. It tracks
  `NVIDIA/cuda-rust` `upstream/main`.
- Short-lived branches may be used for Windows enablement work, experiments,
  CI fixes, and compatibility patches.
- Keep Windows patches narrow and reviewable. Prefer build-system, path,
  environment, and documentation helpers over API changes.
- Do not add fork-only public API unless it has been discussed and documented.
- Linux regressions block Windows changes unless the pull request documents why
  the regression is unavoidable and what follow-up restores parity.
- Update the divergence log only for intentional behavior differences, not for
  transient merge conflict resolution or ordinary documentation refreshes.

## Upstream Sync

Configure the upstream remote once:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-rust.git
git remote -v
```

Refresh upstream state:

```bash
git fetch upstream --tags
git checkout main
git status --short
```

Regular sync should use this fetch-plus-merge flow on `main` so the fork keeps
its published history intact while still carrying upstream commits promptly.

The working tree must be clean before merging. If you have unfinished Windows
work, move it to a short-lived branch before syncing.

Merge upstream:

```bash
git merge --no-ff upstream/main
```

Do not rewrite published `main` history for routine syncs.

Conflict policy:

- Preserve upstream behavior first. Prefer the upstream file when behavior is
  unrelated to Windows support.
- Re-apply Windows helpers after the upstream version is understood.
- Keep compatibility patches narrow: paths, environment discovery, CI, docs,
  and smoke support before public API changes.
- Do not use conflict resolution to introduce Linux behavior changes.
- Update this file only when the resolved result intentionally diverges from
  upstream behavior.

Run the canonical no-GPU checks from the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\sync-upstream.ps1 -RunChecks
```

Push a completed sync only after the checks pass:

```powershell
.\scripts\sync-upstream.ps1 -RunChecks -Push
```

The helper merges `upstream/main` into `main` and, when `-Push` is passed,
uses a normal `git push origin main`. It does not create releases, move tags,
or change versions.

On a Windows GPU host, also run the full Windows smoke path:

```powershell
cargo oxide doctor
cargo oxide build vecadd
cargo oxide run vecadd
.\cuda-oxide\scripts\smoketest.ps1
```

When a sync changes Windows readiness, update
[CHANGELOG.windows.md](CHANGELOG.windows.md). Keep the changelog focused on
validated targets, requirements, examples, unsupported items, and known
release-readiness gaps.

## Maintenance Cycle

- Daily and weekly upstream monitor: `.github/workflows/upstream-monitor.yml`
  compares this fork with `NVIDIA/cuda-rust/main` and opens or updates one
  issue when upstream has new commits.
- Weekly upstream sync: `.github/workflows/upstream-sync-main.yml` merges
  `NVIDIA/cuda-rust/main` into `main`, runs `.\scripts\sync-upstream.ps1
  -RunChecks -Push`, and opens or updates one issue if the sync fails.
- Weekly hosted Windows canary: `.github/workflows/windows.yml` runs the
  no-GPU MSVC lane on GitHub-hosted `windows-latest`.
- Manual sync: run `.\scripts\sync-upstream.ps1 -RunChecks`; add `-Push` only
  after the local result is clean.
- Release rule: publish `windows-vX.Y.Z` only when upstream has released
  `vX.Y.Z`. Sync-only rebuilds do not invent new project versions.

## Divergence Log Format

from upstream:

## Current Divergence Log

## 2026-06-22 - Upstream sync and non-rewriting maintenance

- Branch: `main` Windows release fork branch tracking `upstream/main`.
- Upstream baseline: `upstream/main@d63a0a8d3fef2db450ee342bdcd862a7829c3cbb`,
  CUDA-Oxide 0.2.1.
- Files/area: upstream merge integration, cargo-oxide backend cache handling,
  cuda-core upstream behavior, and sync automation.
- Intentional divergence: keep the Windows support layer on current upstream
  through merge-based `main` syncs.
- Linux impact: intended to be none. Upstream `DeviceBuffer` behavior and
  backend cache source/toolchain invalidation are preserved; Windows-specific
  artifact naming, release-profile backend builds, and loader path handling
  remain scoped to Windows targets.
- Windows validation: run the no-GPU sync sequence and hosted Windows canary
  before publishing release artifacts.
- Follow-up: no new `windows-vX.Y.Z` release is needed until upstream publishes
  a new CUDA-Oxide release baseline.

## 2026-06-18 - Upstream sync and stronger Windows canary

- Branch: `main` Windows release fork branch tracking `upstream/main`.
- Upstream baseline: `upstream/main@56b843f618d973aef6ae4cb613b590008df09a70`,
  CUDA-Oxide 0.2.1.
- Files/area: Windows CI, cargo-oxide backend loader-path handling, and
  cuda-core sync repair.
- Intentional divergence: keep the Windows support layer synced with current
  upstream while strengthening the hosted no-GPU Windows canary to install
  `libffi:x64-windows` through a temporary vcpkg manifest seeded with the
  runner's vcpkg baseline, build the codegen backend, and compile-check
  `vecadd`.
- Linux impact: intended to be none. The sync repair preserves the existing
  `DeviceBuffer` behavior while filling fields required by upstream's
  async-free model.
- Windows validation: `cargo oxide setup` built
  `rustc_codegen_cuda.dll` in release profile, and
  `cargo oxide build vecadd --arch sm_75` completed successfully.
- Follow-up: no new `windows-vX.Y.Z` release is needed until upstream publishes
  a new CUDA-Oxide release baseline.

## 2026-06-14 - Windows support layer

- Branch: `main` Windows release fork branch tracking `upstream/main`.
- Upstream baseline: `upstream/main@cb318ad4e4e37f5e1913ed0a13478af990e857f7`,
  CUDA-Oxide 0.2.1.
- Files/area: CUDA Toolkit discovery, Windows/MSVC path handling, platform
  artifact naming, loader environment handling, import-library checks,
  bindgen/CUDA compatibility, Windows CI, and smoke scripts.
- Intentional divergence: add native Windows support infrastructure for
  `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` while keeping upstream Linux behavior first. The
  Windows layer covers CUDA Toolkit discovery, Windows and MSVC paths,
  `.exe`/`.dll`/`.obj` platform naming, `PATH` loader behavior, `cuda.lib` and
  `ffi.lib` checks, bindgen/CUDA type compatibility, Windows CI, and
  PowerShell smoke scripts.
- Linux impact: intended to be none. If a Windows helper conflicts with
  upstream Linux behavior, preserve upstream behavior first and re-apply only
  the Windows-specific compatibility needed for MSVC support.
- Windows validation: `cargo build -p cargo-oxide`,
  `cargo test -p oxide-artifacts --features object`,
  `cargo oxide doctor`, `cargo oxide build vecadd`, GPU-host
  `cargo oxide run vecadd`, and `.\scripts\smoketest.ps1` as applicable.
- Follow-up: during each upstream sync, check whether upstream has added native
  equivalents and remove fork-only helpers when upstream behavior covers the
  Windows case.
