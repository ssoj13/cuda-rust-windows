//! The row width belongs to the slice, so there is no per-call width to
//! disagree about. This is the case that made the earlier design unsound: two call sites
//! on one slice could pass different launch-uniform values, or one call site
//! could select between two of them under a thread-varying condition, and two
//! threads would then resolve the same element through "disjoint" tiles.
//!
//! Both spellings below are rejected: `tile_2d32_rt` takes only the thread
//! coordinate, and a slice built for one row width cannot be rebuilt for
//! another.
