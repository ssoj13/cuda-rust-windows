//! Device math that avoids local memory.
//!
//! `f32::sin` / `f32::cos` lower to libdevice `__nv_sinf` / `__nv_cosf`. Their
//! argument reduction has two paths: a three-constant Cody-Waite reduction for
//! `|x| < 105615`, and a Payne-Hanek reduction for larger arguments that keeps
//! a seven-word table in local memory. Every inlined call carries both, so a
//! kernel that only ever sees small angles still gets a local-memory frame,
//! local loads and stores, and several hundred instructions per call site.
//!
//! [`sin_cos`] is the first path alone: the same constants, the same
//! correctly-rounded operations in the same order, hence the same bits as
//! libdevice for every argument it accepts. One reduction serves both results.
//! It is plain Rust (`core` float math), so host code, such as a CPU twin of a
//! device function, computes the same bits instead of hitting a device-only
//! intrinsic.
