//! GPU atomic operations with explicit scope and memory ordering.
//!
//! This module provides atomic types for CUDA device code. Unlike
//! `core::sync::atomic`, these types have explicit **scope** (which threads
//! see the atomic) baked into the type, and all memory orderings map directly
//! to PTX ordering qualifiers.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! | Prefix           | PTX scope | Which threads observe it            |
//! |------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
//! | `DeviceAtomic*`  | `.gpu`    | All threads on the GPU (device)     |
//! | `BlockAtomic*`   | `.cta`    | Same thread block only              |
//! | `SystemAtomic*`  | `.sys`    | GPU **and** CPU (unified memory)    |
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! All five standard orderings are supported:
//!
//! | Variant   | PTX qualifier | Cost     |
//! |-----------|---------------|----------|
//! | `Relaxed` | `.relaxed`    | Cheapest |
//! | `Acquire` | `.acquire`    | Low      |
//! | `Release` | `.release`    | Low      |
//! | `AcqRel`  | `.acq_rel`    | Medium   |
//! | `SeqCst`  | `fence.sc` + op | Highest  |
//!
//! # Types
//!
//! | Type                         | Operations                                 |
//! |------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
//! | Integer (U32, I32, U64, I64) | load, store, all RMW ops, compare_exchange |
//! | Float (F16, F32, F64)        | load, store, fetch_add, fetch_sub, swap    |
//!
//! Float atomics do **not** support compare_exchange (PTX has no `atom.cas`
//! for float types) or bitwise operations.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use cuda_device::atomic::{DeviceAtomicU32, AtomicOrdering};
//!
//! #[kernel]
//! fn histogram(data: &[u32], bins: &mut [DeviceAtomicU32]) {
//!     let idx = cuda_device::thread::index_1d();
//!     let val = data[idx];
//!     bins[val as usize].fetch_add(1, AtomicOrdering::Relaxed);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Performance: a scoped atomic load cannot be served from L1
//!
//! `load` and `store` here are *coherent* at their scope. An L1 cache is not
//! coherent across SMs, so a device- or system-scoped atomic access bypasses L1
//! by construction, on every call, however weak its ordering. Relaxed does not
//! make it cheap; relaxed only removes ordering, not coherence.
//!
//! That matters when the access is on a hot path and the algorithm does not
//! actually need coherence. A common shape is a hash table where a thread
//! publishes a key and then an index, and readers must not observe the first
//! without the second. Reading the index with `load` on every lookup pays an
//! uncached access every time, when the index is almost always already
//! published. Reading it plainly first and falling back to `load` only while
//! genuinely waiting keeps the common path in L1.
//!
//! Measured on such a probe loop: doing it the first way took the L1 sector hit
//! rate from 54% to 29%, pushed 1.7x the sectors through to L2, and made the
//! kernel 24% slower, with the entire difference showing up as
//! `long_scoreboard` warp stalls. No instruction count changes; only where the
//! data is allowed to live.
//!
//! Use these types where you need cross-thread visibility. Do not reach for
//! them by reflex just because a location is shared.
//!
//! # Naming and overlap with `core::sync::atomic`
//!
//! Device-scope types are named **`DeviceAtomic*`** (e.g. `DeviceAtomicU32`) so they
//! do not collide with `core::sync::atomic::AtomicU32`. Block and system scopes
//! keep the `BlockAtomic*` and `SystemAtomic*` prefixes.
//!
//! The ordering enum is **`AtomicOrdering`** (not `Ordering`) so you can use
//! `Ordering` from the standard library without a name clash. For example:
//! `use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicU32, Ordering};` for host/cpu code, and
//! `use cuda_device::atomic::{DeviceAtomicU32, AtomicOrdering};` for device code.
//!
//! # Host–device ABI
//!
//! The ABI is the same for atomics on host and device: `core::sync::atomic::AtomicT`
//! and `DeviceAtomicT` / `BlockAtomicT` / `SystemAtomicT` have the same layout
//! (a single `T`). The same allocation can be used from host and device in
//! unified memory without conversion.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! Each method is a stub that the cuda-oxide compiler recognizes by name and
//! replaces with the correct LLVM atomic instruction. The method bodies are
//! never executed -- they exist only so the type checker and borrow checker
//! work normally during development.
