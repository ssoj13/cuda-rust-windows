# `src/main.rs` invokes this binary at startup to measure the live
# closest-supported cublasLtMatmul reference on the host GPU (replacing B200
# constants). Run this once after entering your dev shell, or whenever
# CUDA_HOME / cublasLt changes.

# Picks the CUDA toolkit in this priority order:
#   1. $CUDA_HOME            (set by the cuda-oxide `nix develop`)
#   2. $CUDA_PATH            (alternative env var some toolchains use)
#   3. /usr/local/cuda       (system install)

# Usage:
#   cd bench
#   bash build.sh
