# Verify both crate inventories still list every workspace member: README.md's
# Crate Overview and the book's Crate Map.
#
# The overview is the only map of the tree a newcomer gets, and a crate absent
# from it is invisible: nothing else in the repo enumerates the members for a
# human, and no build fails when one goes unlisted.  `dialect-iket` and
# `iket-lower` were both missing when this guard was written -- 1,700 lines of
# compiler across two crates, with no row between them.
#
# Direction matters.  Every member needs a row; extra rows are fine and
# expected.  `rustc-codegen-cuda` is deliberately not a workspace member (it
# needs its own [workspace] for the rustc_private dylibs) and is listed anyway,
# which is right -- readers care about the crate, not about which workspace
# resolves it.  So this checks for members with no row, never for rows with no
# member.
#
# Members are read from CUDA Oxide's Cargo.toml rather than from `cargo metadata`:
# the question is which crates the workspace declares, which is exactly what
# that list says, and reading it needs no cargo, no lockfile and no network.
#
# The book's Crate Map is the second inventory and it claims completeness in
# so many words -- "cuda-oxide is split into focused crates. Here is every one
# and its role" -- while sitting outside this guard's reach.  It listed 15 of 28
# when #970 found it, missing `dialect-iket` and `iket-lower` among eleven
# others: the same two crates whose absence from README.md is why this script
# exists.  One guard, both tables, so a new member cannot be absent from either.
#
# Run this after adding or removing a workspace member.
