## Prerequisites

| Requirement      | Version             | Notes                                                         |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linux**        | Ubuntu 24.04 tested | Other distros may work but are untested                       |
| **NVIDIA GPU**   | Ampere+ (sm_80+)    | Driver 580+ (a CUDA 13.x driver; loaded at run time)          |
| **CUDA Toolkit** | 13.0+               | `nvcc`, `cuda.h` and `curand.h` must be available             |
| **LLVM**         | 21+                 | Must include the NVPTX backend                                |
| **Clang**        | 21+                 | `clang-21` — needed by `bindgen` for host `cuda-bindings`     |
| **Rust**         | Latest stable       | Selected by `rust-toolchain.toml`                             |

The shared `cuda-bindings` crate loads the CUDA driver at the first driver
call, not at build time. A binary can start without a driver; the first call
then reports `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED` and the attempted library paths.
The driver must support the CUDA major version used to build the binary.

Windows runtime discovery and hosted CI are community-maintained by
[ansidium](https://github.com/ansidium). Hosted runners check compilation and
library loading; kernel execution is validated manually on Windows GPU hardware.

## Dev Container

The repository includes a cuda-oxide devcontainer in `cuda-oxide/.devcontainer/`.
Using it is the quickest way to get a reproducible development environment with
CUDA Toolkit 13.0, LLVM 21, Clang 21, and stable Rust already
installed.

The host does not need the CUDA Toolkit installed. It does need:

- an NVIDIA GPU
- an NVIDIA driver compatible with CUDA 13.0 (R580 or newer)
- Docker with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed

With a devcontainer-aware editor, open the checkout's `cuda-oxide/` folder
and choose "Reopen in Container". The editor reads its `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`,
builds the image, and requests GPU access with `--gpus=all`. The container
mounts the whole repository so the shared host crates remain available,
and opens `/workspaces/cuda-rust/cuda-oxide`.

For CLI-only usage, run from the repository root:

```bash
npx -y @devcontainers/cli up --workspace-folder ./cuda-oxide \
  --config ./cuda-oxide/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

Then run commands inside it with:

```bash
npx -y @devcontainers/cli exec --workspace-folder . cargo install --locked --path crates/cargo-oxide
npx -y @devcontainers/cli exec --workspace-folder . cargo oxide doctor
npx -y @devcontainers/cli exec --workspace-folder . cargo oxide run vecadd
```

If the host driver is too old, GPU commands such as `nvidia-smi`,
`cargo oxide doctor`, or `cargo oxide run vecadd` will fail inside the
container. Update the host NVIDIA driver rather than installing a different
CUDA Toolkit in the container.

If you use the devcontainer, you can skip the manual CUDA, LLVM, Clang, and
Rust setup sections below.

---

## Nix / flake.nix

The repository also ships a `flake.nix` providing a reproducible dev shell
(CUDA 13, LLVM 22, Clang, stable Rust). Requires
[Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) with flakes enabled, an NVIDIA driver on
the host, and Linux (x86\_64 or aarch64).

From the repository root, enter the cuda-oxide workspace; `cargo-oxide` is included in the shell:

```bash
cd cuda-oxide
nix develop
cargo oxide run vecadd
```

From an exact checkout of the Windows fork, bootstrap a new project with:

```bash
nix run .#new -- my-project
cd my-project && nix develop
```

This scaffolds via `cargo oxide new` and drops in a `flake.nix` that inherits
this repo's dev shell. The shellHook auto-discovers host NVIDIA driver
libraries on NixOS and non-NixOS systems; if the host driver is too old,
update it rather than changing what's inside the Nix shell.

To add the same development environment to an existing project, run inside
that project:

```bash
nix flake init -t 'github:NVIDIA/cuda-rust?dir=cuda-oxide'
nix develop
```

If you use the Nix flake, you can skip the manual CUDA, LLVM, Clang, and
Rust setup sections below.

---

## CUDA Toolkit

Install the CUDA Toolkit from the [NVIDIA CUDA Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) page, then make sure it is on your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
```

Verify the install:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

:::{tip}
If you installed CUDA to a non-default location, set `CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH` to its root directory (the one containing `include/cuda.h`). If neither `CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH` nor `CUDA_HOME` is set, these roots are tried in order and the first one holding a `cuda.h` of CUDA 13.0 or newer wins: `/usr/local/cuda-13.3`, `/usr/local/cuda-13.2`, `/usr/local/cuda-13`, `/usr/local/cuda`. With more than one toolkit installed, that order decides — not the highest version, and not the `/usr/local/cuda` symlink, which is last. `cargo oxide doctor` reports which root it resolved and why any earlier one was turned down.

### Toolkit and driver compatibility

The CUDA toolkit and NVIDIA driver are separate installations. A newer toolkit
can often run with an older driver through CUDA minor-version compatibility,
but that compatibility does not cover newer PTX:

```text
cubin ───────────────────────────► driver loads finished GPU code
PTX   ──► driver compiles it ─────► finished GPU code
```

The normal cuda-oxide path gets PTX from LLVM `llc`, so installing a newer CUDA
toolkit does not by itself change that PTX version. The NVVM forward-execution
path gets PTX from the selected toolkit's nvJitLink. If that PTX is newer than
the driver understands, module loading returns
`CUDA_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_PTX_VERSION` (error 222).

For example, the toolchains used during current validation produced:

```text
LLVM llc ───────────────► PTX 8.7 ──► driver 580 ✓
CUDA 13.3 nvJitLink ───► PTX 9.3 ──► driver 580 ✗ error 222
```

These are observed versions, not permanent properties of the two paths. Check
the generated PTX `.version` directive when diagnosing another toolchain.

CUDA 13.x minor-version compatibility starts at driver 580, while CUDA 13.3's
corresponding full-support driver is 610.43.02. A 580 driver can therefore load
compatible finished cubins, but it cannot JIT PTX 9.3 produced by CUDA 13.3.
See the [CUDA release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html)
for the current driver table.

Upgrade the driver or select a compatible toolkit for the command:

```bash
CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-13.0 cargo oxide run <example> --arch sm_86
```

See NVIDIA's
[minor-version compatibility guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/minor-version-compatibility.html)
for the supported driver ranges and PTX limitation.

---

## LLVM 21+ (optional)

cuda-oxide uses LLVM's NVPTX backend to lower LLVM IR to PTX.

Usually `llc` in Rust toolchain is enough.

Install LLVM 21 or newer and make sure `llc-21` (or `llc-22`) is on your `PATH`:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install llvm-21
```

If your distro packages do not provide `llvm-21`, use LLVM's apt helper:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y lsb-release wget software-properties-common gnupg
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh && chmod +x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 21
```

Verify that the NVPTX target is present:

```bash
llc-21 --version | grep nvptx
```

You should see a line containing `nvptx64` in the registered targets. The
pipeline auto-discovers `llc-23`, `llc-22`, and `llc-21` in that order; pin a specific
binary with `CUDA_OXIDE_LLC=/usr/bin/llc-21` if needed.

:::{warning}
A stock LLVM build without the NVPTX backend will not work. The `llvm-21` Ubuntu package includes it by default, but if you build LLVM from source you must pass `-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;NVPTX"` to CMake.
:::

:::{important}
**Why LLVM 21?** We emit TMA / tcgen05 / WGMMA intrinsics that `llc` from LLVM 20 and earlier can't handle. Simple kernels might still work with an older `llc` (set `CUDA_OXIDE_LLC=/path/to/llc-20`), but anything Hopper / Blackwell needs 21+.
:::

---

## Clang (host `cuda-bindings`)

The host `cuda-bindings` crate runs [`bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen), which loads `libclang.so` at runtime and needs clang's own resource-dir `stddef.h` — a bare `libclang1-*` runtime is not enough. Three packages cover both halves:

```bash
sudo apt install libclang-21-dev libclang-cpp21-dev libclang-common-21-dev
```

`cargo oxide doctor` catches this up front; the symptom otherwise is `'stddef.h' file not found` during the host build.

:::{tip}
**If doctor still reports clang not found:**
The issue may be that the versioned binary (e.g., clang-21) is installed but not mapped to the unversioned clang command required by bindgen. You can fix this by installing the clang meta-package, which manages these dependencies automatically:

```bash
sudo apt install clang libclang-dev
```

:::

:::{note}
**Fresh Ubuntu 24.04 / DGX-OS:** after installing LLVM 21 via `apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh` as shown above, the versioned `clang-21` / `clang++-21` binaries are present but the unversioned aliases `cargo oxide doctor` looks for are not. Add them with `update-alternatives`:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang   clang   /usr/bin/clang-21   100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-21 100
```

Validated on Asus GX10 / NVIDIA DGX Spark.

## Rust toolchain

The workspace ships a `rust-toolchain.toml` that selects the stable channel and
required components. When you first run any `cargo` command inside the repo,
`rustup` installs the toolchain automatically.

If you need to install it manually:

```bash
rustup update stable
rustup component add rust-src rustc-dev rust-analyzer rustfmt clippy llvm-tools --toolchain stable
```

Three of these components are what the codegen backend and doctor need:

- `rust-src` -- source of the Rust standard library, needed for cross-compiling to the NVPTX target.
- `rustc-dev` -- compiler internals that the backend links against.
- `llvm-tools` -- toolchain-bundled `llc` used to lower LLVM IR to PTX (doctor's floor check).

The other three are not needed to build: `rust-analyzer` powers IDE support,
`clippy` is the lint gate CI runs, and `rustfmt` backs `cargo oxide fmt`.

:::{note}
On Windows MSVC, install the same stable toolchain and components, then confirm
the host target is `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. The fork's Windows environment
variables and validation commands are listed in
[the Windows setup doc](windows.md).

## cargo-oxide

`cargo-oxide` is the cargo subcommand that drives the entire build pipeline (`cargo oxide run`, `build`, `debug`, `pipeline`, and the rest -- the Command reference at the end of this section lists all of them).

**Inside the cuda-oxide repo**, install the current checkout so the
`cargo-oxide` executable exactly matches the sources you are testing:

```bash
cargo +stable install --locked --path crates/cargo-oxide
```

**For use outside the repo** (your own projects), install it with the stable toolchain:

```bash
cargo +stable install --locked --git https://github.com/ansidium/cuda-rust-windows.git --rev 53adc37eb7af836ff014c1204f0d9327dbeb1330 cargo-oxide
```

On first run, `cargo-oxide` will automatically fetch and build the codegen backend. Subsequent runs reuse the cached build.

To discover the examples available in a cuda-oxide checkout:

```bash
cargo oxide list
cargo oxide list --json
```

The command reports each example's purpose and any documented GPU, architecture,
CUDA Toolkit, or external SDK requirements.

Useful day-to-day helpers once you are building kernels:

```bash
# Print generated PTX without the full MIR/LLVM pipeline dump
cargo oxide inspect vecadd

# Remove local target/ dirs and generated device artifacts (PTX, LLVM IR,
# LTOIR, cubin, and their sidecar metadata)
cargo oxide clean
```

`inspect` is the lightweight counterpart to `cargo oxide pipeline`. `clean`
only touches project-local outputs; it leaves the shared backend cache at
`~/.cargo/cuda-oxide/` alone.

### Command reference

The full set, as `cargo oxide --help` reports it:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `run` | Build and run an example or project |
| `sanitize` | Build and run an example or project under NVIDIA Compute Sanitizer |
| `build` | Build an example or project (compile only, don't run) |
| `fuzz-schedule` | Find schedule-sensitive failures by perturbing an example's generated PTX |
| `test` | Run Cargo tests through the cuda-oxide backend |
| `emit-ltoir` | Compile a crate's device code to a binary LTOIR artifact in one step |
| `pipeline` | Show the full compilation pipeline (MIR -> PTX/NVVM IR) with verbose output |
| `debug` | Build with debug info and launch `cuda-gdb` |
| `list` | List the examples bundled with the cuda-oxide workspace |
| `inspect` | Build an example or project and print the generated PTX |
| `fmt` | Format all crates (SIMT workspace, codegen backend, examples) |
| `new` | Scaffold a new standalone cuda-oxide project |
| `clean` | Remove project-local build outputs and generated cuda-oxide artifacts |
| `doctor` | Check that your environment is set up correctly |
| `setup` | Build and cache the codegen backend |
| `update` | Refresh the cached codegen backend (or run `setup` inside the workspace) |

Four of these are worth calling out, because they do something `cargo` itself
cannot:

```bash
# Run the test suite with device code compiled by the cuda-oxide backend.
# Arguments after `--` go to cargo; with none it is a plain `cargo test`.
cargo oxide test -- --lib

# Format every scope the fmt CI gate checks: the SIMT workspace, the codegen
# backend, the cuda-macros device-only fixture, and every manifest under
# examples/ including nested ones. Each is its own [workspace], so a single
# `cargo fmt` at the root misses most of them.
cargo oxide fmt
cargo oxide fmt --check

# Rebuild the cached backend after changing compiler crates or the toolchain
# pin. Inside the workspace this advises `setup`; --force runs it.
cargo oxide update

# Produce the LTOIR a tile or C++ kernel links against. LTOIR is
# architecture-specific, so --arch is required rather than inferred.
cargo oxide emit-ltoir my_kernels --arch sm_90
```

Every command takes `--help`, which lists the flags each one accepts.

## Verifying your installation

Run the built-in diagnostics check:

```bash
cargo oxide doctor
```

`cargo oxide doctor` validates your Rust toolchain, CUDA headers (`cuda.h`),
CUDA toolkit (including libNVVM / nvJitLink / libdevice for kernels that use
math intrinsics), LLVM installation, NVIDIA driver / GPU, and codegen backend
in one shot.

`cargo-oxide` itself does not need the CUDA toolkit or an NVIDIA driver to
build and run, so `doctor` works even on a machine where nothing is installed
yet and diagnoses exactly what is missing (for example missing `cuda.h`, or
no driver). The driver / GPU check is informational: only `cargo oxide run`
needs a GPU, while `build` and `pipeline` work without one.

Then build and run an example end-to-end:

```bash
cargo oxide run vecadd
```

If everything is configured correctly, this compiles a Rust kernel to PTX, launches it on the GPU, and prints a success message.

:::{tip}
**Common issues:**

- `No working llc found` -- prefer `rustup component add llvm-tools --toolchain stable`, or install LLVM 21+ (`sudo apt install llvm-21`), add `/usr/lib/llvm-21/bin` to your `PATH`, or set `CUDA_OXIDE_LLC=/usr/bin/llc-21`.
- `'stddef.h' file not found` when building host `cuda-bindings` -- install clang dev headers: `sudo apt install clang-21` (or `libclang-common-21-dev`).
- `cuda.h not found` -- Set `CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH` to your CUDA install root, or ensure `/usr/local/cuda/include/cuda.h` exists.
- `rust-src` / `llvm-tools` component missing -- Run `rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools --toolchain stable`.
