//! Future type that bridges CUDA stream callbacks with Rust's async executor.
//!
//! [`DeviceFuture`] drives a [`DeviceOp`] through a small state machine:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Idle ──first poll──> Executing ──completion signal──> Complete
//!            (execute on the stream,          (hand out the result)
//!             then inline spin, then
//!             register for completion)
//! ```
//!
//! # Cancellation
//!
//! Dropping the future never cancels submitted GPU work; kernels run to
//! completion regardless. What the drop decides is *when the host releases
//! the resources that work still uses*. A future dropped while its work is
//! in flight therefore waits for the stream to drain before dropping its
//! undelivered result (the owned output — buffers, DMA targets — plus the
//! execution context's stream and pool handles). If the wait cannot be
//! performed (a faulted context, a stream mid-capture) the result is leaked:
//! releasing memory the device may still write to is the worse failure. The
//! leak is reported on stderr unless the future already resolved with the
//! stream's fault — then the caller has the error and the leak is its
//! documented consequence. See [`DeviceFuture`]'s type docs for why the
//! wait is synchronous.
