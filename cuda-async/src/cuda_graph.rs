///
/// ## Capture mode prevents concurrent GPU execution
///
/// The scope's stream is in **capture mode** during the closure (via
/// `cuStreamBeginCapture`). In capture mode:
///
/// 1. **No GPU work executes.** `record` records operations as graph
///    nodes — kernels are not launched, memcpys are not issued. There
///    is no in-flight GPU work that could race with anything.
///
/// 2. **Same-stream ordering is preserved.** All `record` calls go to
///    the same capture stream. When the graph is later launched via
///    [`CudaGraph::launch`], the nodes execute in recorded order on a
///    single stream. Sequential same-stream execution is ordered — no
///    data races.
///
/// 3. **Other executions inside the closure are rejected.** The scope
///    holds the thread-local execution lock for the duration of the
///    closure, so `op.sync_on(&other_stream)`, `op.sync()`, and
///    `op.sync_on(&capture_stream)` all return the non-reentrant
///    `DeviceError` before reaching the driver. Nothing executes eagerly
///    alongside the recording. (Independently, CUDA itself rejects
///    synchronizing or querying a capturing stream with
///    `CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED`.) The one way around the
///    lock is a [`then_unchecked`](DeviceOp::then_unchecked) chain recorded
///    via `record`, whose closure may execute eagerly — that is exactly the
///    caller's `unsafe` assertion.
///
/// 4. **Borrow checker enforces `&mut` exclusivity.** `record` consumes
///    the op, releasing `&mut`. The next `record` can then borrow the
///    same buffer as `&` for reading.
///
/// ## `GraphNode` prevents allocation during capture
///
/// `record` accepts [`GraphNode`] (not [`DeviceOp`]). `GraphNode` is only
/// implemented by operations that do not allocate or free device memory
/// (kernel launches, `memcpy`, `value`). This prevents:
///
/// - **Address instability:** `cuMemAllocAsync` during capture allocates
///   memory, but on replay the allocation node may return a different
///   address. Subsequent nodes bake in the capture-time pointer — UB.
///
/// - **Uninitialized reads:** An allocation during capture gives the user
///   a tensor handle. The initialization (e.g., memset from `zeros`) was
///   recorded, not executed. Passing the tensor to `sync_on(&other_stream)`
///   reads uninitialized memory.
///
/// - **Invalid frees:** If a tensor allocated inside the scope is dropped,
///   `cuMemFreeAsync` is recorded. On replay, it frees the capture-time
///   address, which may no longer be valid.
///
/// Since no tensors can be allocated inside the scope, all buffers are
/// pre-allocated and passed in via borrows. No tensor created inside
/// the scope means no tensor dropped inside the scope.
///
/// # What happens if you call other operations inside the closure
///
/// While `s.record(op)` is the intended API, other operations inside
/// the closure have well-defined behavior:
///
/// | Operation | What happens |
/// |---|---|
/// | `op.sync_on(&capture_stream)` | Non-reentrant execution-lock error; nothing executes |
/// | `op.sync_on(&other_stream)` | Non-reentrant execution-lock error; nothing executes |
/// | `op.sync()` / `op.await` | Non-reentrant execution-lock error; nothing executes |

///         let forward_op = build_forward(h_input.clone().into());
///         let mut graph = forward_op.graph_on(stream)?;
///         let output = graph.take_output().unwrap();
///         Ok(Self { graph, h_input, output })
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl Module for MyModel {
///     type Input = Arc<Tensor<f32>>;
///     type Output = Arc<Tensor<f32>>;
///
///     fn forward(&mut self, input: Self::Input)
///         -> Result<Self::Output, DeviceError>
///     {
///         self.graph.update(
///             api::memcpy(&mut self.h_input, &input)
