# The cuTile Rust Book

Source for the cuTile Rust Book. To build and serve it locally:

```
make setup
source .venv/bin/activate
make livehtml
```

The local server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default.

For local development, use the single-version book build:

```
make livehtml
```

or, from the repository root:

```
cutile-rs/scripts/run_book.sh serve
```

GitHub Pages uses the versioned site build instead. To run the same build entry
point locally, run from the repository root:

```
cutile-rs/scripts/build_versioned_book.sh
```

The generated site is written to `cutile-rs/_site/` by default.
