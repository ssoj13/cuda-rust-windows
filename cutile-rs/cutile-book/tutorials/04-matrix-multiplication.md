## Naive GEMM is Memory-Bound

The naive algorithm for C = A × B is:

```text
for each output element C[i,j]:
    sum = 0
    for k in 0..K:
        sum += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
    C[i,j] = sum
```

![Memory bandwidth problem showing the mismatch between naive GEMM and GPU capabilities](../_static/images/gemm-memory-bandwidth.svg)

Each element of A and B is loaded from global memory repeatedly. To get good performance, we need to load data once and reuse it many times.

---

## Tiled Matrix Multiplication

Instead of computing one element at a time, we compute **tiles** of elements:

![Tiled GEMM showing how tiles from A and B combine to form output tile C](../_static/images/gemm-tiled-strategy.svg)

```text
Per output TILE (BM × BN elements):
  - Load BM × K elements from A (once per row group)
  - Load K × BN elements from B (once per column group)
  - Do BM × BN × K multiply-adds

Memory loads: BM×K + K×BN    Compute: BM×BN×K ops
Ratio: With BM=BN=BK=16: ~16× better data reuse!
```

Each loaded element of A is reused BN times, and each element of B is reused
BM times. This reduces global-memory traffic.

## GEMM kernel

```rust
use cuda_async::device_operation::DeviceOp;
use cuda_core::Device;
use std::sync::Arc;
use cutile;
use cutile::api;
use cutile::DType;
use cutile::error::Error;
use cutile::tensor::{IntoPartition, Tensor, ToHostVec, Unpartition};
use cutile::tile_kernel::TileKernel;

#[cutile::module]
mod my_module {
    use cutile::core::*;

    #[cutile::entry()]
    fn gemm<E: ElementType, const BM: i32, const BN: i32, const BK: i32, const K: i32>(
        z: &mut Tensor<E, { [BM, BN] }>,   // Output tile
        x: &Tensor<E, { [-1, K] }>,        // A matrix
        y: &Tensor<E, { [K, -1] }>,        // B matrix
    ) {
        let part_x = x.partition(shape![BM, BK]);
        let part_y = y.partition(shape![BK, BN]);
        let pid_m = program_id(0);
        let pid_n = program_id(1);

        let mut tile_z = load_tile_mut(z);

        for i in 0i32..(K / BK) {
            let tile_x = part_x.load([pid_m, i]);
            let tile_y = part_y.load([i, pid_n]);
            tile_z = mma(tile_x, tile_y, tile_z);  // C += A @ B
        }
        z.store(tile_z);
    }
}

use my_module::gemm;

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let device = Device::new(0)?;
    let stream = device.new_stream()?;

    let (bm, bn, bk) = (16usize, 16usize, 8usize);
    let (m, n, k) = (64usize, 64usize, 64usize);

    let generics = vec![
        f32::DTYPE.as_str().to_string(),
        bm.to_string(), bn.to_string(), bk.to_string(), k.to_string()
    ];

    let z = api::zeros(&[m, n]).partition([bm, bn]).sync_on(&stream)?;
    let x: Arc<Tensor<f32>> = api::ones(&[m, k]).map(Into::into).sync_on(&stream)?;
    let y: Arc<Tensor<f32>> = api::ones(&[k, n]).map(Into::into).sync_on(&stream)?;

    let (z, _x, _y) = gemm(z, x, y).generics(generics).sync_on(&stream)?;

    let z_host: Vec<f32> = z.unpartition().to_host_vec().sync_on(&stream)?;
    println!("z[0] = {} (expected {})", z_host[0], k);


    Ok(())
}
```

**Output:**

```text
z[0] = 64 (expected 64)
```

Each output element is the dot product of a row of ones with a column of ones, which equals K. With K=64, every output element is 64.

---

## The K-Loop

The K-loop iterates over pairs of tiles from A and B, accumulating partial products into the output tile:

```rust
for i in 0i32..(K / BK) {
    let tile_x = part_x.load([pid_m, i]);  // Load A[row_group, i]
    let tile_y = part_y.load([i, pid_n]);  // Load B[i, col_group]
    tile_z = mma(tile_x, tile_y, tile_z);  // Accumulate: C += A @ B
}
```

![K-loop showing how partial products accumulate across iterations](../_static/images/gemm-kloop.svg)

---

## The `mma()` Intrinsic

`mma` stands for **Matrix Multiply-Accumulate**:

```rust
tile_z = mma(tile_x, tile_y, tile_z);
// Equivalent to: tile_z = tile_x @ tile_y + tile_z
```

On modern GPUs (Volta and later), this maps directly to **Tensor Cores** — specialized hardware that can multiply small matrices (like 16×16×16) in a single operation.

---

## Const Generics and JIT Recompilation

```rust
fn gemm<E: ElementType, const BM: i32, const BN: i32, const BK: i32, const K: i32>
```

These are **const generics** — values known at compile time:

1. **Loop unrolling:** `for i in 0..(K/BK)` can be fully unrolled.
2. **Register allocation:** The compiler knows exactly how many registers are needed.
3. **Tensor Core mapping:** The hardware requires specific tile sizes.

They are passed via `.generics()`:

```rust
let generics = vec!["f32".to_string(), "16".to_string(), "16".to_string(), "8".to_string(), "64".to_string()];
gemm(z, x, y).generics(generics)
```

Changing a type parameter or const generic in the entry function signature creates a new compiled variant. The first time a variant is launched, cuTile compiles the kernel through Tile IR bytecode → cubin. The resulting binary is cached, so subsequent launches that resolve to the same variant reuse it. Launching with different generics — for example, switching from `K=64` to `K=128` — produces a new compilation. The full cache rules, including compile options and specialization hints, are covered in [Compilation](../guide/jit-compilation.md).

This is the tradeoff between **static** and **dynamic** shape dimensions. In the GEMM signature above, `K` is a const generic while the M and N dimensions of `x` and `y` are dynamic (`-1`):

```rust
x: &Tensor<E, { [-1, K] }>,   // M is dynamic (-1), K is static
y: &Tensor<E, { [K, -1] }>,   // K is static, N is dynamic (-1)
```

- **Static dimensions** (const generics) enable aggressive optimization but trigger recompilation when they change.
- **Dynamic dimensions** (`-1`) carry no optimization benefit but can vary freely across launches without creating a new compiled variant.

As a rule, make tile sizes (`BM`, `BN`, `BK`) static — they are fixed for a given kernel variant and the compiler needs them for register allocation and Tensor Core mapping. Make problem dimensions that change often (such as sequence length or batch size) dynamic.

![Performance comparison between naive and tiled GEMM](../_static/images/gemm-performance-comparison.svg)

With larger tiles (like 128×128), you can achieve even better ratios, approaching the GPU's theoretical peak.

---

## Const Generic Inference

SAXPY needs no `.generics()` call: cuTile infers the const generics from the
host-side output partition.

Consider SAXPY's kernel signature:

```rust
fn saxpy<const S: [i32; 2]>(
    y: &mut Tensor<f32, S>,
    a: f32,
    x: &Tensor<f32, { [-1, -1] }>
)
```

On the host side, `y` is a `Partition<Tensor<f32>>` created by calling `.partition([2, 2])`. The `partition_shape` of that `Partition` — `[2, 2]` — is used to infer `S`. Since `S` is the only const generic and it appears directly in the `&mut Tensor<f32, S>` parameter, cutile can infer everything it needs from the host-side types alone. No `.generics()` call required.

The inference rule is the same as Rust: const generics that appear in the shape of a `&mut Tensor` are read from the `Partition`'s `partition_shape`, and const generics that appear in the shape of a `&Tensor` are read from the tensor's `shape`. Type parameters like `E: ElementType` are inferred from the tensor's `dtype()`.

For GEMM, this inference is **partial**:

```rust
fn gemm<E: ElementType, const BM: i32, const BN: i32, const BK: i32, const K: i32>(
    z: &mut Tensor<E, { [BM, BN] }>,   // BM, BN inferred from z's partition_shape
    x: &Tensor<E, { [-1, K] }>,        // K inferred from x's shape[1]
    y: &Tensor<E, { [K, -1] }>,        // K also available from y's shape[0]
)
```

| Generic | Appears in | Inferred from | Inferable? |
|---------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| `E` | `z`, `x`, `y` | `z.dtype()` | Yes |
| `BM` | `z` (`&mut`) | `z.partition_shape[0]` | Yes |
| `BN` | `z` (`&mut`) | `z.partition_shape[1]` | Yes |
| `K` | `x`, `y` | `x.shape()[1]` | Yes |
| `BK` | — | — | No |

`BM` and `BN` are known at kernel launch time because they are embedded in the `Partition` created by `.partition([bm, bn])`. `K` is known because it appears as a dimension of the input tensors `x` and `y`. But `BK` does not appear in the type of any kernel argument — it is only used *inside* the kernel body when partitioning `x` and `y` into tiles:

```rust
let part_x = x.partition(shape![BM, BK]);
let part_y = y.partition(shape![BK, BN]);
```

The launcher cannot infer `BK` from a tensor or partition, so GEMM needs an
explicit `.generics()` call.

As a general rule: if every const generic appears somewhere in the kernel's `&Tensor` or `&mut Tensor` parameter types, inference will work and `.generics()` is optional. If any const generic is used only inside the kernel body (like `BK`), you must pass all generics explicitly.

## GEMM optimization

The GEMM kernel above is correct but does not reach the GPU's theoretical peak
(speed-of-light, or SoL) throughput. The recommended safe path is mapped
persistent GEMM: the output partition produces bounded, disjoint indices, and
the compiler derives the input bounds from the loops that produce each index.
This avoids `unsafe` and does not require making full tensor dimensions const
generics.

### Approach 1: Mapped Persistent GEMM (Safe, Recommended)

Mapped output partitions expose an iterator over output tile indices. The
indices are produced by the partition itself, so stores are bounded and
disjoint. The K-loop iterates `0..num_tiles(&part_x, 1)` and indexes the input
partitions with plain arrays; the compiler infers the same bounds from the loop
and the mapped components, and verifies the cross-tensor ties (for example
`ceil(dim(x, 1)/BK) <= ceil(dim(y, 0)/BK)`) as launch checks before any GPU
work. `deny_in_kernel_checks = true` turns any check that would remain in the
kernel into a compile error, so the body is assert-free by construction:

```rust
#[cutile::entry(
    optimization_hints = (
        sm_120 = (num_cta_in_cga = 2,),
        sm_100 = (num_cta_in_cga = 2,),
    ),
    deny_in_kernel_checks = true,
)]
fn gemm_persistent<
    T: ElementType,
    const BM: i32,
    const BN: i32,
    const BK: i32,
    const MAP_SHAPE: [i32; 2],
>(
    mut z: MappedPartitionMut<T, { [BM, BN] }, MAP_SHAPE>,
    x: &Tensor<T, { [-1, -1] }>,
    y: &Tensor<T, { [-1, -1] }>,
) {
    let part_x = x.partition(shape![BM, BK]);
    let part_y = y.partition(shape![BK, BN]);

    for out_idx in z.iter_indices() {
        let (bid_m, bid_n) = out_idx.components();

        let mut tile_z: Tile<T, { [BM, BN] }> = constant(T::ZERO, shape![BM, BN]);
        for k_tile in 0i32..num_tiles(&part_x, 1) {
            let tile_x = part_x.load([bid_m, k_tile]);
            let tile_y = part_y.load([k_tile, bid_n]);
            tile_z = mma(tile_x, tile_y, tile_z);
        }
        z.store(tile_z, out_idx);
    }
}
```

`with_bounds(...)`, `Dim::new(...)`, and `coord(...)` from earlier versions of
this kernel are deprecated since 0.3.0; see
[Bounds-Check Placement](../guide/bounds-check-placement.md) for the placement
rules.

On the host side, `.map(...)` selects the mapped output traversal and the launch
grid is inferred from the mapped partition:

```rust
let z = z.partition([BM, BN]).map([4, 1], num_tile_blocks);
let (z, _x, _y) = gemm_persistent(z, x, y)
    .generics(generics)
    .sync_on(&stream)?;
```

Changing the full runtime tensor dimensions does not require recompilation.
Only the type-level parameters, such as tile sizes and the map shape, specialize
the JIT compilation.

See [`cutile-examples/examples/persistent_gemm.rs`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-rust/blob/main/cutile-rs/cutile-examples/examples/persistent_gemm.rs) for the complete example.

### Approach 2: Disabling Bounds Checks (Unsafe)

The `#[cutile::entry()]` attribute accepts `unchecked_accesses` and
`optimization_hints`. Setting `unchecked_accesses = true` disables runtime
bounds checks on all tensor loads and stores and requires an `unsafe` entry
point. `optimization_hints` supplies architecture-specific tuning parameters:

```rust
#[cutile::entry(
    unchecked_accesses = true,
    optimization_hints = (
        sm_120 = (num_cta_in_cga = 2, max_divisibility = 16,),
    )
)]
unsafe fn gemm<T: ElementType, const BM: i32, const BN: i32, const BK: i32>(
    z: &mut Tensor<T, { [BM, BN] }>,
    x: &Tensor<T, { [-1, -1] }>,
    y: &Tensor<T, { [-1, -1] }>,
    k: i32,
) {
    let part_x = x.partition(shape![BM, BK]);
    let part_y = y.partition(shape![BK, BN]);
    let pid_m = program_id(0);
    let pid_n = program_id(1);
    let mut tile_z: Tile<T, { [BM, BN] }> = z.load();
    for i in 0i32..(k / BK) {
        let tile_x = part_x.load([pid_m, i]);
        let tile_y = part_y.load([i, pid_n]);
        tile_z = mma(tile_x, tile_y, tile_z);
    }
    z.store(tile_z);
}
```

This version changes three parts of the kernel:

- **`unchecked_accesses = true`** removes bounds-checking overhead on every `load` and `store` call.
- **`sm_120 = (num_cta_in_cga = 2, max_divisibility = 16,)`** is an architecture-specific hint for Blackwell (SM 120) that groups two CTAs into a CGA for better inter-SM data sharing and caps auto-inferred alignment at 16.
- **`k` is passed as a runtime `i32`** rather than a const generic, so changing the K dimension does not create a new compiled variant.

The compiler still checks tile shapes, `mma` dimensions, and element types.
`unchecked_accesses` disables only runtime bounds checks.

The call site must also use an `unsafe` block:

```rust
unsafe {
    let (z, _, _, _) = gemm(z, x, y, k as i32)
        .generics(generics)
        .sync_on(&stream)?;
}
```

See [`cutile-benchmarks/benches/gemm.rs`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-rust/blob/main/cutile-rs/cutile-benchmarks/benches/gemm.rs) for a full benchmark comparing optimized and unoptimized variants.

### Approach 3: Fully Static GEMM (Safe, Legacy)

The older safe performance path is to make **all** tensor dimensions static const
generics. When the compiler knows every dimension and the launch grid at JIT
time, it can prove direct `program_id(axis)` partition accesses are in bounds
and optimize the checks away entirely - no `unsafe` required:

```rust
#[cutile::entry()]
fn gemm<
    E: ElementType,
    const BM: i32, const BN: i32, const BK: i32,
    const M: i32, const N: i32, const K: i32,
>(
    z: &mut Tensor<E, { [BM, BN] }>,
    x: &Tensor<E, { [M, K] }>,
    y: &Tensor<E, { [K, N] }>,
) {
    let part_x = x.partition(shape![BM, BK]);
    let part_y = y.partition(shape![BK, BN]);
    let mut tile_z = load_tile_mut(z);
    let pid_m = program_id(0);
    let pid_n = program_id(1);
    for i in 0i32..(K / BK) {
        let tile_x = part_x.load([pid_m, i]);
        let tile_y = part_y.load([i, pid_n]);
        tile_z = mma(tile_x, tile_y, tile_z);
    }
    z.store(tile_z);
}
```

In this version:

- **`x: &Tensor<E, { [M, K] }>` and `y: &Tensor<E, { [K, N] }>`** — input dimensions are fully static instead of dynamic (`-1`). The compiler sees the exact shape of every tensor.
- **No `unsafe`, no `unchecked_accesses`** — bounds checks are present in the source but the JIT compiler proves they are redundant and eliminates them during optimization.
- **`M`, `N`, `K` are const generics** — they must be passed via `.generics()` at launch time, and every new combination creates a new compiled variant.
- **`.const_grid(grid)`** — optional. The launch grid is inferred from the output partition as usual; `.const_grid()` additionally passes the grid as a compile-time constant, which gives the compiler exact bounds for `program_id(axis)` / `num_programs(axis)` and makes the grid part of the specialization key (each distinct grid is its own compiled variant). The grid is computed from the output partition (`let grid = z.grid()?`):

```rust
let grid = z.grid()?;
let (z, _x, _y) = gemm(z, x, y)
    .const_grid(grid)
    .generics(generics)
    .sync_on(&stream)?;
```

See [`cutile-examples/examples/gemm_static.rs`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-rust/blob/main/cutile-rs/cutile-examples/examples/gemm_static.rs) for the legacy static example.

### Choosing Between the Approaches

| | Mapped Persistent | Unsafe + Hints | Fully Static |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Safety** | Safe bounded/disjoint output iteration | `unsafe` - programmer must ensure correct dimensions | Safe - compiler verifies direct static accesses |
| **Compilation behavior** | Tile sizes and map shape create new compiled variants | Tile sizes create new compiled variants | Every full tensor shape creates a new compiled variant |
| **Flexibility** | Problem sizes can change at runtime | Problem sizes can change at runtime | Each new problem size is a new compilation |
| **Compile-time checks** | Tile shapes, types, and mapped index proofs | Tile shapes and types still checked | All shapes and types checked |
| **Best for** | Default high-performance safe GEMM | Escape hatch for manually proven kernels | Legacy fixed-size kernels |

Start with mapped persistent GEMM. An unsafe kernel requires a manual proof of
its access pattern and is useful when that pattern cannot yet be expressed in
the safe DSL. Fully static GEMM suits older kernels or a small, fixed set of
tensor shapes.

### Exercise 1: Change Tile Sizes

Experiment with different `(BM, BN, BK)` values:
- Try `(32, 32, 16)` — larger tiles.
- Try `(8, 8, 4)` — smaller tiles.

Measure each configuration over multiple runs. Which is faster?

### Exercise 2: Non-Square Matrices

Modify to multiply `[M, K] @ [K, N]` where M ≠ N:

```rust
let (m, n, k) = (128, 256, 64);  // Non-square output
```

Does the code need changes?

### Exercise 3: Mixed Precision

Try using `f16` (half precision) for inputs and `f32` for the accumulator. This is common in ML for faster compute.
